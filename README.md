# Website-Blocker

created a website blocker using tkinter library of python, where we can type the url of the websites and then we can block those websites.
also have an unblock feature added to it so that we can unblock any website in future if we want and Tkinter Module for creating GUI.
Made two functions Block() and Unblock(). As the names suggest these functions will perform blocking and unblocking of websites respectively. These websites are added to the host file of the system.
